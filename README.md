A mod for the ploopy thumb trackball. Based off of mine which I have shaved the back off. That's right, if you want a gaming thumb trackball now there is hope, but there might be some work involved.

## Based on the ThumbBodyParts-NoLogo-200.step files from ploopyco.

This is the first version, which can be found in  /STEPs, however, I find it is decent for my size hand, but with a wedge I feel I need to shave off even more. It might be ok for larger hands in it's current state.

There **WILL** be revisions. Too cold today to stay in the shed. Currently a variety of tools are being used to shape the body - scroll saw, sanders, files, dremel. Eventually 3D printed... and STL files released.

## **ProtoTIT mission**

To make an alternate shape for the ploopy thumb trackball that is nice to hold.

**RawAccel** is a blessing for trackballs

https://github.com/a1xd/rawaccel/releases/tag/v1.6.0

I am trying out stupidly high DPI's { 6000,12000 }
With a Sens Multiplier of 0.1 to give effectively 600/1200 DPI.

The idea being high DPI giving a smoother acceleration.

Motivity Curve with Motivity set to 2, and midpoint set to 30 (other settings are default).

This seems to give nice control at slower speeds, but the ability to quickly look behind almost like a flick. Usually fairly low in-game sensitivity.
